# myfirst-neural-network-regressor

This is a simple implementation of two-layered perceptron for approximation of sin(x) function

## There are simple experiments in main.py:
- the script creates 30 regressors and teaches each of them on the same data
- then MAE is calculated and printed in console for each regressor
- the output on test data is visualized on charts in `charts` directory
- the randomness is removed (a seed is set)
